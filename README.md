# Usescripts

#### What are user scripts?

User scripts put you in control of your browsing experience. Once installed, they automatically make the sites you visit better by
adding features, making them easier to use, or taking out the annoying bits.

#### How do I install user scripts?

To use user scripts you need to first install a user script manager.

* Firefox and related browsers: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
